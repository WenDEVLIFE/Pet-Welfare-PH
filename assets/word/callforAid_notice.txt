Call for Aid
(in-kind or financial)

NOTICE BEFORE POSTING

We prefer to see proof of activity, proof that you need assistance. Take photos of yourself with the pets you care for. Show us the situation, tell us the details, what kind of assistance you need, and how we can send help (address for supplies or financial details for money transfer). Don’t beat around the bush and go straight to the point. BE WARNED! If you’re found to be lying and scamming others, you will be banned and may face legal consequences! Thank you.

NOTICE BEFORE POSTING

Tell us about the pet. Don’t try to hide certain details which you think might stop other people from wanting the fur babies. Give it to them straight if the pet has health issues, or behavioral issues, or whatnot. The right people will adopt them no matter what. We don’t want them to be dumped back on the streets, so screen the applicants very carefully. There is a checklist. Be sure the adopter checks all the boxes. Be sure to do a video call. Don’t bother with those who don’t want to show their faces. If you need help for legit checks, ask the community. Thank you.

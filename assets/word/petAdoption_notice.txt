Tell us about the pet. Don’t try to hide certain details which you think might stop other people from wanting the fur babies. Give it to them straight if the pet has health issues, or behavioral issues, or whatnot. The right people will adopt them no matter what. We don’t want them to be dumped back on the streets, so screen the applicants very carefully. There is a checklist. Be sure the adopter checks all the boxes. Be sure to do a video call. Don’t bother with those who don’t want to show their faces. If you need help for legit checks, ask the community. Thank you.
